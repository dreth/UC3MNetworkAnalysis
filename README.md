# Dataset source/authors

I did not construct or author the GitHub network dataset used for the group project, it was all obtained from the [Stanford University SNAP database](http://snap.stanford.edu/data/github-social.html).

It is originally sourced from the following paper: [Multi-scale Attributed Node Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13021)

The github repo for that project is [benedekrozemberczki/MUSAE](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/MUSAE).

Many thanks to [**Benedek Rozemberczki**](https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki), **Carl Allen** and **Rik Sarkar** for sourcing and creating this dataset.
